    "- Try using masks for obstacle examples since, it will get rid of background (May give better results).\n",
    "- Instead of using template matching to detect obstacles you can use contour detection.\n",
    "- Duck when you detect Crow at a certain height.\n",
    "- Check for the canvas to go dark and then use another obstacle list, (This list will contain the same obstacles but inverted), this way you can even get along when it goes dark.\n",
    "- Most Importantly Map the Jump variable as a function of time, so as the time increases (so does the speed of incoming obstacles) your dinosaur jumps. So in simple terms you will have to decrease the distance for jumping when the time increases as obstacles will be coming at you at a faster speed."
